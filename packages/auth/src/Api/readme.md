# Usage  
The APIs and states are available by using the using the `useAuth()` hook:
```jsx
import { useAuth } from "@frontegg/react-auth";

const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
if (isAuthenticated) {
  console.log(`Yay! ${user.email} is authenticated!`);
}
```

The `useAuth()` allows to get status and call apis on each of the functionalities exposed by the Frontegg Authentication Module.

## Auth states

### isAuthenticated
```jsx
const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
```
True in case the user is authenticated. Otherwise false

### error
```jsx
const { error } = useAuth();
```
Indicates whether there is an error in the authentication flow

### isLoading
```jsx
const { isLoading } = useAuth();
```
Indicates whether the react provider is loading the authentication state

### user
```jsx
const { user } = useAuth();
```
Returns the logged in user (in case the user is logged in) OR null in case of no 
authentication

### isSSOAuth
```jsx
const { isSSOAuth } = useAuth();
```
Indicates whether SSO authentication is enabled on the Frontegg Portal

### isSSOAuth
```jsx
const { isSSOAuth } = useAuth();
```

### loginState
```jsx
const { loginState } = useAuth();
```
Returns the current login state. Can be one of the following values: <br/>

`preLogin` - indicates that we are in the pre-password step<br/>
`loginWithPassword` - indicates that we are waiting for password input<br/>

`success` - Indicates that we are successfully authenticated<br/>
`recoverTwoFactor` - Indicates that we are recovering MFA for this user<br/>

```
Returns the current user activation state

### acceptInvitationState

```jsx
const { preLogin } = useAuth();

preLogin({ email });
```

#### login
Logs in the user using email and password and updates the authentication state accordingly

```jsx
const { login } = useAuth();

login({ email, password });
```

#### loginWithMfa
2nd step of authentication using a MFA token and code

```jsx
const { loginWithMfa } = useAuth();

loginWithMfa({ mfaToken, value: code });
```

#### recoverMfa
Recovers MFA for a user using an email address and the users' recovery code

```jsx
const { recoverMfa } = useAuth();

recoverMfa({ email, recoveryCode: code })
```

#### logout
